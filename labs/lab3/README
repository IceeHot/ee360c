EE360C Programming Lab 3

**** !!NOTICE!! ****
A binary for Mac OS X and Linux x86_64 >=2.6.32 has been generated and
is provided in the top level (RUN-OSX and RUN-LINUX, respectively).

I'm using the cmake build system because it is a much better way to
achieve platform-independence. It's much better than pure makefiles,
where are not a very good way to make sure your project will build
properly under any computer.

The output of 'uname -a' for each machine I built the included binaries
on has been provided below:

Darwin rMBP15.local 14.0.0 Darwin Kernel Version 14.0.0: Fri Sep 19 00:26:44 PDT 2014; root:xnu-2782.1.97~2/RELEASE_X86_64 x86_64
Linux cortex 3.16.4-1-ARCH #1 SMP PREEMPT Mon Oct 6 08:22:27 CEST 2014 x86_64 GNU/Linux

**** DEPENDENCIES ****
This project requires the following dependencies to build and run:
- CMake >= 2.8.7
- Boost
  - program_options
  - filesystem
  - system
- GCC >= 4.7 or LLVM >= 3.5
- GNU Make >= 4.0

The documentation requires the following:
- LaTeX 2e
- pdfTeX

**** BUILDING ****
Once you have the required dependencies, and are in the directory
containing this README file, please do the following:
> mkdir -p build && cd !$
> cmake ..
> make lab3

If you wish to also compile the documentation, please do the
following, in addition to the above steps:
> make pdf

If you would like to build everything, simply run "make" as it will,
by default, build both the documentation and the source code.

**** RUNNING ****
If you're using gcc, please edit src/CMakeLists.txt and uncomment
the section indicated "For gcc". If you would like to generate a
static binary, uncomment the section indicated "For gcc, static
binary". By default, the "For clang" section is uncommented. Please only
have one of these options uncommented.

When completely compiled, the binary will be located in:
${YOUR_BUILD_DIR}/src-bin/lab3. The report pdf will be located in
${YOUR_BUILD_DIR}/doc-bin/writeup.pdf. If you followed the
instructions above, your build directory will be simply "build".

The following options are supported:
  -i [ --input-file ] arg input file(s)
  -o [ --output-dir ] arg output directory
  -h [ --help ]           produce this help message

The "-i" is optional, as the default parameter will be interpreted as
an input file.
