EE360C Programming Lab 1

**** !!NOTICE!! ****
I'm currently trying to get it to compile under Linux, but have not
gotten a binary yet. I have a Darwin-compiled binary using Clang/LLVM
on OS X Mavericks. I'll update the package once I get a Linux 3.2
binary. The code should remain the same

**** DEPENDENCIES ****
This project requires the following dependencies to build and run:
- CMake >= 3.0
- Boost
  - program_options
  - filesystem
  - system
- Clang >= 3.5
- GNU Make >= 4.0

The documentation requires the following:
- LaTeX 2e
- pdfTeX

**** BUILDING ****
Once you have the required dependencies, and are in the directory
containing this README file, please do the following:
> mkdir -p build && cd !$
> cmake ..
> make lab1

If you wish to also compile the documentation, please do the
following, in addition to the above steps:
> make pdf

If you would like to build everything, simply run "make" as it will,
by default, build both the documentation and the source code.

**** RUNNING ****
When completely compiled, the binary will be located in:
${YOUR_BUILD_DIR}/src-bin/lab1

If you followed the instructions above, your build directory will be
simply "build".

The following options are supported:
  -i [ --input-file ] arg input file(s)
  -o [ --output-dir ] arg output directory
  -h [ --help ]           produce this help message

The "-i" is optional, as the default parameter will be interpreted as
an input file.
