EE360C Programming Lab 2

**** !!NOTICE!! ****
A binary for Arch Linux 3.16 has been generated and is provided in the top level.

I'm using the cmake build system because it is a much better way to
achieve platform-independence. It's not perfect, but it's much better
than pure makefiles, where are not the absolute best way to make sure
your project will build properly under any computer.

The output of 'uname -a' for the machine I built the included binary
on has been provided below.

Linux arch-utility 3.16.3-1-ARCH #1 SMP PREEMPT Wed Sep 17 21:54:13 CEST 2014 x86_64 GNU/Linux

**** DEPENDENCIES ****
This project requires the following dependencies to build and run:
- CMake >= 3.0
- Boost
  - program_options
  - filesystem
  - system
- GCC >= 4.7
- GNU Make >= 4.0

The documentation requires the following:
- LaTeX 2e
- pdfTeX

**** BUILDING ****
Once you have the required dependencies, and are in the directory
containing this README file, please do the following:
> mkdir -p build && cd !$
> cmake ..
> make lab2

If you wish to also compile the documentation, please do the
following, in addition to the above steps:
> make pdf

If you would like to build everything, simply run "make" as it will,
by default, build both the documentation and the source code.

**** RUNNING ****
If you're using clang, please edit src/CMakeLists.txt and uncomment
the section indicated "For clang". If you would like to generate a
static binary, uncomment the section indicated "For gcc, static
binary". By default, the "For gcc" section is uncommented. Please only
have one of these options uncommented.

When completely compiled, the binary will be located in:
${YOUR_BUILD_DIR}/src-bin/lab2. The report pdf will be located in
${YOUR_BUILD_DIR}/doc-bin/writeup.pdf.

If you followed the instructions above, your build directory will be
simply "build".

The following options are supported:
  -i [ --input-file ] arg input file(s)
  -o [ --output-dir ] arg output directory
  -h [ --help ]           produce this help message

The "-i" is optional, as the default parameter will be interpreted as
an input file.
